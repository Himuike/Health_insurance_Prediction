# Health Insurance Prediction Data science Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing an insurance dataset to predict insurance charges based on various customer features. The goal is to apply data science techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning to uncover insights and build predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Sex**: Gender of the customer
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index (BMI)
- **Children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
- **Smoker**: Whether the customer is a smoker
- **Region**: The region the customer belongs to
- **Charges**: The medical charges billed to the customer (target variable)

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values and converting categorical variables to numerical ones.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize the data to identify patterns and correlations.
3. **Feature Selection**: Select the most relevant features for predicting insurance charges.
4. **Modeling**: Train machine learning models (such as Linear Regression,Polynomial Regression, etc.) to predict insurance charges.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, etc.
